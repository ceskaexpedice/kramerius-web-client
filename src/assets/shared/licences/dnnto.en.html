    This includes works that are not in the public domain (i.e. less than 70 years has passed since 
    the death of the last surviving author and they were published less than 50 or 110 years ago 
    for monographs and periodicals respectively), but they cannot be found on the market anymore. 
    The list of these works is overseen by the National Library of the Czech republic and to view it, visit  
    <a href="https://dnnt.nkp.cz/seznam.html" target="_blank">this page</a>. 
    Out-of-commerce works are available to registered users on grounds of a licence agreement 
    between the National Library of the Czech republic and the collective rights’ management 
    organisation DILIA and the association for the protection of authors’ rights  OOA-S. 
    For further information on possibilities to access out-of-commerce works visit

    Registered users of participating institutions have remote access to out-of-commerce works. 
    Unfortunately, digital documents are accessible for czech residents only
    (or for foreigners with residence or student permit etc.). 
    The Moravian Library can't provide remote library registration for foreigners.
