    This includes works that are not in the public domain (i.e. less than 70 years has passed 
    since the death of the last surviving author and they were published less than 50 or 110 years ago 
    for monographs and periodicals respectively), but they cannot be found on the market anymore. 
    After logging in, monographs with a publication date up to 2000 and periodicals up to the year 
    of publication 2010 can be made available online, as well as monographs published 
    between 2001 and 2007 from terminals in the participating libraries. 
    The list of these works is overseen by the National Library of the Czech republic and to view it, visit 
    <a href="https://dnnt.nkp.cz/seznam.html" target="_blank">this page</a>. 
    Out-of-commerce works are available to registered users on grounds of a licence agreement 
    between the National Library of the Czech republic and 
    the collective rights’ management organisation DILIA and the association 
    for the protection of authors’ rights  OOA-S. 
    For further information on possibilities to access out-of-commerce works visit

    Registered users of participating institutions have remote access to out-of-commerce works. 
    One of the libraries is also the Moravian Library in Brno, 
    which offers its users the possibility of remote 
    <a href="https://www.mzk.cz/en/services/registration" target="_blank">registration</a>. 
    Unfortunately, digital documents are accessible for czech residents  only (or for 
    foreigners with residence or student permit etc.). 
    The Moravian Library can't provide remote library registration for foreigners.
