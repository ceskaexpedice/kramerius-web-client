<strong>What should I do if I cannot get to a reading room in the Moravian Library?</strong>
<p>
    One of the options is to ask the National Library of the Czech Republic for a paper 
    copy of the digital document, provided that they have this particular document in their own 
    <a href="http://www.digitalniknihovna.cz/nkp" target="_blank">digital library</a>
    If that is the case, fill in the 
    <a href="http://www.nkp.cz/sluzby/formulare/kramerius-objednavka" target="_blank">order form</a>
    Another option is to visit your nearest library and even if they do not have the title physically present, 
    you can apply for an interlibrary loan service. 
    For more information on the availability of the title and libraries that own it, use the central portal 
    <a href="https://www.knihovny.cz/" target="_blank">Knihovny.cz</a>.
