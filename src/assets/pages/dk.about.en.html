Welcome to Digitalni knihovna, the digital library which offers digital documents through the Kramerius system and contains both free and copyrighted works of various genres in a web interface with access to multiple digital libraries in the Czech Republic. The Digital Library Web Design provides a simple and understandable way to work with digital documents. The Digital Library is operated by the Moravian Library in Brno.

<h3>Content</h3>
<p>
In the Digital Library you can find digitized books, newspapers and magazines, maps, manuscripts, archival materials, sound recordings, graphics, music and electronic documents created directly in digital form (eg professional proceedings).
</p>
<p>The documents are referenced from the <a target="blank" href="https://aleph.nkp.cz/F/?request=&local_base=SKC&func=find-b&find_code=WRD&CON_LNG=ENG">Union Catalogue of the Czech Republic</a> and our library catalogue <a target="blank" href="https://vufind.mzk.cz/?lng=en">Vufind</a>.

<h3>Copyright law</h3>
<p>Some documents are publicly accessible and some can be viewed only in the library building due to copyright protection. We can set public documents 70 years after the death of the author or co-author (in the case of periodicals and unknown authors 70 years after publishing the issue) and 50 years after publishing.</p>

<p>Private documents are accessible from computers at the study rooms of document's home library. If you think the document should be publicly available, <a href="mailto:digitalniknihovna@mzk.cz" target="blank">contact us</a>!
