    This includes works that are not in the public domain (i.e. less than 70 years has passed since the death of the last surviving author 
and they were published less than 50 or 110 years ago for monographs and periodicals respectively), but they cannot be found on the market anymore. 
After logging in, monographs with a publication date up to 2000 and periodicals up to the year of publication 2010 can be made available online, 
as well as monographs published between 2001 and 2007 from computer terminals in the participating libraries. The list of these works is overseen 
by the National Library of the Czech republic and to view it, visit <a href="https://dnnt.nkp.cz/seznam.html" target="_blank">this page</a>. 
Out-of-commerce works are available to registered users on grounds of a licence agreement between the National Library of the Czech republic 
and the collective rights’ management organisation DILIA and the association for the protection of authors’ rights  OOA-S. For further information 
on possibilities to access out-of-commerce works visit this <a href="https://dnnt.nkp.cz/" target="_blank">this website</a>.

    Registered users of participating institutions have remote access to out-of-commerce works. One of the libraries is also the Moravian Library in Brno, 
which offers its users the possibility of remote <a href="https://www.mzk.cz/en/services/registration" target="_blank">registration</a>. Unfortunately, digital 
documents are accessible for czech residents  only (or for foreigners withresidence or student permit etc.). 
The Moravian Library can't provide remote library registration for foreigners.
